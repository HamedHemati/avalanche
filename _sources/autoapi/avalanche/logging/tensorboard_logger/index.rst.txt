   Bases: :class:`avalanche.logging.StrategyLogger`

   The `TensorboardLogger` provides an easy integration with
   Tensorboard logging. Each monitored metric is automatically
   logged to Tensorboard.
   The user can inspect results in real time by appropriately launching
   tensorboard with `tensorboard --logdir=/path/to/tb_log_exp_name`.

   AWS's S3 buckets and (if tensorflow is installed) GCloud storage url are
   supported.

   If no parameters are provided, the default folder in which tensorboard
   log files are placed is "./runs/".
   .. note::
       We rely on PyTorch implementation of Tensorboard. If you
       don't have Tensorflow installed in your environment,
       tensorboard will tell you that it is running with reduced
       feature set. This should not impact on the logger performance.

   Creates an instance of the `TensorboardLogger`.

   :param tb_log_dir: path to the directory where tensorboard log file
       will be stored. Default to "./tb_data".
   :param filename_suffix: string suffix to append at the end of
       tensorboard log file. Default ''.

   .. method:: __del__(self)


   .. method:: log_single_metric(self, name, value, x_plot)

      This abstract method will have to be implemented by each subclass.
      This method takes a metric name, a metric value and a x value and
      decides how to show the metric value.

      :param name: str, metric name
      :param value: the metric value, will be ignored if
          not supported by the logger
      :param x_plot: an integer representing the x value
          associated to the metric value
