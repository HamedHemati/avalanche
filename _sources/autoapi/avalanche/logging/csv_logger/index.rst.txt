.. py:class:: CSVLogger(log_folder=None)

   Bases: :class:`avalanche.logging.StrategyLogger`

   The `CSVLogger` logs accuracy and loss metrics into a csv file.
   Metrics are logged separately for training and evaluation in files
   training_results.csv and eval_results.csv, respectively.
   This Logger assumes that the user is evaluating on only one experience
   during training (see below for an example of a `train` call).

   Trough the `EvaluationPlugin`, the user should monitor at least
   EpochAccuracy/Loss and ExperienceAccuracy/Loss.
   If monitored, the logger will also record Experience Forgetting.
   In order to monitor the performance on held-out experience
   associated to the current training experience, set
   `eval_every=1` (or larger value) in the strategy constructor
   and pass the eval experience to the `train` method:
   `for i, exp in enumerate(benchmark.train_stream):`
       `strategy.train(exp, eval_streams=[benchmark.test_stream[i]])`

   When not provided, validation loss and validation accuracy
   will be logged as zero.

   The training file header is composed of:
   training_exp_id, epoch, training_accuracy, val_accuracy,
   training_loss, val_loss.

   The evaluation file header is composed of:
   eval_exp, training_exp, eval_accuracy, eval_loss, forgetting

   Creates an instance of `CSVLogger` class.

   :param log_folder: folder in which to create log files.
       If None, `csvlogs` folder in the default current directory
       will be used.

   .. method:: log_single_metric(self, name, value, x_plot) -> None

      This abstract method will have to be implemented by each subclass.
      This method takes a metric name, a metric value and a x value and
      decides how to show the metric value.

      :param name: str, metric name
      :param value: the metric value, will be ignored if
          not supported by the logger
      :param x_plot: an integer representing the x value
          associated to the metric value


   .. method:: print_train_metrics(self, training_exp, epoch, train_acc, val_acc, train_loss, val_loss)


   .. method:: print_eval_metrics(self, eval_exp, training_exp, eval_acc, eval_loss, forgetting)


   .. method:: after_training_epoch(self, strategy: BaseStrategy, metric_values: List['MetricValue'], **kwargs)

      Called after `train_epoch` by the `BaseStrategy`. 


   .. method:: after_eval_exp(self, strategy: BaseStrategy, metric_values: List['MetricValue'], **kwargs)

      Called after `eval_exp` by the `BaseStrategy`. 


   .. method:: before_training_exp(self, strategy: BaseStrategy, metric_values: List['MetricValue'], **kwargs)

      Called before `train_exp` by the `BaseStrategy`. 


   .. method:: before_eval(self, strategy: BaseStrategy, metric_values: List['MetricValue'], **kwargs)

      Manage the case in which `eval` is first called before `train`


   .. method:: before_training(self, strategy: BaseStrategy, metric_values: List['MetricValue'], **kwargs)

      Called before `train` by the `BaseStrategy`. 


   .. method:: after_training(self, strategy: BaseStrategy, metric_values: List['MetricValue'], **kwargs)

      Called after `train` by the `BaseStrategy`. 


   .. method:: close(self)
